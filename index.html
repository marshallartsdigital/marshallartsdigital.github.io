	<br><br>With 70 million combined streams and the award for Best Unsigned Female Artist UK 2016, Nessi Gomes is a British Portuguese musician, composer and lyricist of rare invention and beauty.

Born on the tiny Island of Guernsey to a Portuguese family, Gomes channels influences from both sides of her ethnicity, blending the essence of the traditional, emotional and ‘larger than life’ Fado folk music with British progressive modern inspiration.

Nessi’s debut album Diamonds & Demons ensued tales of darkness and light allowing a deeper exploration of the human condition, psyche, collective fears and torments. Nessi and her producer Duncan Bridgeman ('1 Giant Leap’) together dug an uncharted tunnel into the artist's turbulent heart and soul. Nessi went on to tour the album, playing in 25 European countries in the last 6 years including major festivals in Europe.

Diamonds & Demons revealed an authentic and heartfelt search for light, depth, hope and truth; an artistic quest for love and trust. A series of intricately detailed, hauntingly atmospheric and lushly textured Avant-ballads. Gomes is a musician whose work obliquely references her travails and nods to Björk and Kate Bush, while being uniquely her own, with Portuguese inflections and intimations of hope and dread.

                    Night Flight have announced they will play London's Omeara.

The announcement of the new date coincides with the release of new track Monster and the sell out of their EP launch event at London's Next Door Records.

This new date will see Night Flight, Sam Holmes and Harry Phillips, performing with a full band. Their last full band show was the sell-out show at Oslo Hackney in November 2023. 2024 looks set to be a big year for Night Flight. Currently recording their third album, the now duo will release EP English Rose on 10 May and see it as a bridge between Night Flight new and old.

“This was our final session with former drummer Dan Webb and the first step towards a sound driven by Harry and myself,” explains Sam. “Originally meant to be an entirely acoustic affair and recorded ad-hoc in a living room, the songs formed the backbone of a tumultuous year and allowed us to experiment with textures; both lyrically and musically. Mixed by longtime collaborator James Mottorshead and mastered by Nick Watson, these songs highlight our rediscovery of drive and are the first step in what we hope to be an exciting year of releases.”
